# expo-project-boilerplate

When I start any expo project, most of the initial structures and libaries which need to be install and code are always same, so to make it less time consuming and easy. I create this boilerplate.

Packages Included:
* expo
* axios
* react-native-gesture-handler
* react-native-reanimated
* react-native-responsive-screen
* react-native-safe-area-context
* react-query
* react-native-screens
* reactotron-react-native
* ... some more small expo helper libaries
